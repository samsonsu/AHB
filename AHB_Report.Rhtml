<title>Arrival of African Honey Bees in the US</title>

<h1>   
African Honey Bees
</h1>

<h2>   
Introduction
</h2>
<p>The African Honey Bee (AHB), also nicknamed the "killer bee", has had a significant impact on the agricultural economy. This species is unique from many other 
bees because of its extremely defensive nature and the tendency of its colonies to swarm and spread. The implications of the AHB has been astronimical. Areas populated by 
AHB colonies have been quarantined, prohibiting the importation of the European Honey Bee. The subsequent lack of bees has taken a toll on crop pollination. Thus, there has been strong interest in predicting the arrival of the AHB to the United States. The case studied is heavily taken from the <a href="http://www.stat.tamu.edu/~matis/Predicting%20the%20Africanized%20Bee%20Invasion.pdf">work </a> of Matis and Kiffe.

In order to obtain the data below, cardboard box traps with a chemical attractant were placed at an average of every 93km (OR 300-500???m). Then, every month, the boxes were checked for presence of the AHB.</p>

<h2>
Fitting the Data
</h2>

<p>
It was initially thought that the data would follow a normal distribution. However, after fitting a normal QQ plot, we noticed that our data doesn't lie on the 45 degree line. 
We noticed that the sample quantiles towards the right are significantly larger than the theoretical quantiles the normal distribution would predict.



If we were to use a normal distribution to model our data, it would severly underpredict the frequency of extreme values of x. This means that we would understate the possibilities of the AHB arrival.

Knowing this, it's possible that we can fit a better distribution function for the AHB data with the gamma distribution.

<h2>
The Gamma Distribution 
</h2>

<p>
The Gamma Distribution is a continuous probability density function that is used to model the time required to perform some operation. Just as the Poisson distribution is the 
time-continuous distribution of the binomial, so is the gamma distribution the time-continuous analog of the negative binomial.

The Gamma is a prediction of the time of the "rth" random arrival of some event. In this case, we were looking at the rth bee.

A Gamma distribution was chosen to model the unimodal, skewed distribution which takes on only positive values. 

Here they look at the reciprocal of speed, the "transit time" which models instead, the time required to travel a fixed distance.

Displayed below is a graph of the normal vs. the gamma distribution fitted on the data of the estimated transit time for AHBs. We see that the gamma distribution fits the data a lot better and weighs right tailed distributions more likely compared to the normal distribution.

<h2>
Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
The Gamma distribution was found to be a good predictor of the African Honey Bee arrival time. The best fit gamma distribution for this data had an alpha value of 1.61 and a beta value of 2.37. 

The strength of such a distribution is its ability to take into account the natural variability of the arrival. However, its limitations are also plentiful as there are many conditions that are static. For instance, this distribution does not take into account the presence of any predators or environmental factors.

<h2>
Exploring the Distribution Qualitatively 
</h2>
<p>
First, let us explore what the gamma distribution looks like compared again other distributions like the normal, log normal, etc by simulating different number of observations. 
</p

    <label>Distribution type:</label><br />
    <select name="dist">
      <option value="norm">Normal</option>
      <option value="unif">Uniform</option>
      <option value="lnorm">Log-normal</option>
      <option value="exp">Exponential</option>
      <option value="gamma">Gamma</option>
    </select> 
  </p>
  
<p>
    <label>Number of observations:</label><br /> 
    <input type="number" name="n" value="500" min="1" max="1000" />
  </p>

          </p>
<p>Notice that the gamma distribution weighs a higher probability to the higher tail probabilities than the normal distibribution.

<h2>
Alpha and Beta Parameters in the Gamma Distribution
</h2>


<p>
Pick an alpha and beta parameter on the slider below. 

Notice what happens to the shape when you change the alpha parameter to 1, keeping beta constant. Then continue increasing the alpha parameter while keeping the beta constant, and notice what the gamma distribution reesembles as it changes.

Now, observe the change when you vary the beta parameter while keeping the alpha parameter constant. Beta has a strong impact on the shape of the gamma distribution. When beta is less than 1, we tend to observe relatively broad distributions with long tails. As the value of beta increases, the distributions become tighter. This is because the variance of the gamma distribution is alpha/beta^(2)
</p>

Alpha and Beta values are both positive where &#945; is a shape parameter and &#946; is a scale parameter. When &#945; is an integer, it represents the
